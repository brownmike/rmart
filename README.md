# Ruby Mac Adware Removal Tool

Removes some particularly obnoxious adware on Macs.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/brownmike/rmart.git`

Or you can download `rmart.rb`, `rmart` and `adware_definitions.yaml`. Just make sure they're in the same directory.

## Requirements

I've only used it on Mac OS X 10.9 & 10.10

## Usage

If you cloned the repo:

`$ cd rmart ; ./rmart`

Otherwise execute `./rmart` in the directory where the files are

## TODO:
+ Add more adware definitions
+ Create a nicely formatted log file
+ Get some unit tests going

2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
