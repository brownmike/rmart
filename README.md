# Ruby Mac Adware Removal Tool

Removes some particularly obnoxious adware on Macs.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/brownmike/rmart.git`

Or you can download rmart.rb and adware_definitions.yaml. Just make sure they're in the same directory.

## Requirements

I've only used it on Mac OS X 10.9 & 10.10

## Usage

`cd rmart`

`./rmart.rb`

## TODO:
